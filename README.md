So I was updating my Github with badges as per the latest trends. ðŸ˜œ Then I noticed that there were no such badges to show the total number of contributions and total number of commit. I mean, sure there were a lot stats related badges like weekly commits or so but not this. So...

### A simple badge for GitHub Repositories that shows total number of contributions since it's inception!

Bdw, I was feeling pretty lazy to write all the SVGs myself and there were a ton of them already available so I just used the awesome hackable SVG badges from **Shields IO** (https://shields.io/).

Huge shoutout to the Devs! (https://github.com/badges/shields)
